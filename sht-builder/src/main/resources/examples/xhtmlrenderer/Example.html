            <h1>And Thou Art Dead, As Young and Fair</h1>
            <h2>Lord Byron, first published in 1812</h2>

            <img src="/img/byron.jpg" alt="key" width="38" height="50"/>

            <ui:forEach items='${model.items}' var="item"><span>${item}</span></ui:forEach><br/>
            <a href='dump'>dump</a>

            <p>And thou art dead, as young and fair<br/>
                As aught of mortal birth;<br/>
                And form so soft, and charms so rare,<br/>
                Too soon return'd to Earth!<br/>
                Though Earth receiv'd them in her bed,<br/>
                And o'er the spot the crowd may tread<br/>
                In carelessness or mirth,<br/>
                There is an eye which could not brook<br/>
                A moment on that grave to look.</p>

            <p>I will not ask where thou liest low,<br/>
                Nor gaze upon the spot;<br/>
                There flowers or weeds at will may grow,<br/>
                So I behold them not:<br/>
                It is enough for me to prove<br/>
                That what I lov'd, and long must love,<br/>
                Like common earth can rot;<br/>
                To me there needs no stone to tell,<br/>
                'T is Nothing that I lov'd so well.</p>

            <p>Yet did I love thee to the last<br/>
                As fervently as thou,<br/>
                Who didst not change through all the past,<br/>
                And canst not alter now.<br/>
                The love where Death has set his seal,<br/>
                Nor age can chill, nor rival steal,<br/>
                Nor falsehood disavow:<br/>
                And, what were worse, thou canst not see<br/>
                Or wrong, or change, or fault in me.</p>

            <p>The better days of life were ours;<br/>
                The worst can be but mine:<br/>
                The sun that cheers, the storm that lowers,<br/>
                Shall never more be thine.<br/>
                The silence of that dreamless sleep<br/>
                I envy now too much to weep;<br/>
                Nor need I to repine<br/>
                That all those charms have pass'd away,<br/>
                I might have watch'd through long decay.</p>

            <p>The flower in ripen'd bloom unmatch'd<br/>
                Must fall the earliest prey;<br/>
                Though by no hand untimely snatch'd,<br/>
                The leaves must drop away:<br/>
                And yet it were a greater grief<br/>
                To watch it withering, leaf by leaf,<br/>
                Than see it pluck'd to-day;<br/>
                Since earthly eye but ill can bear<br/>
                To trace the change to foul from fair.</p>
