            <h1>And Thou Art Dead, As Young and Fair</h1>
            <h2>Lord Byron, first published in 1812</h2>

            <p>And thou art dead, as young and fair
                As aught of mortal birth;
                And form so soft, and charms so rare,
                Too soon return'd to Earth!
                Though Earth receiv'd them in her bed,
                And o'er the spot the crowd may tread
                In carelessness or mirth,
                There is an eye which could not brook
                A moment on that grave to look.</p>

            <p>I will not ask where thou liest low,
                Nor gaze upon the spot;
                There flowers or weeds at will may grow,
                So I behold them not:
                It is enough for me to prove
                That what I lov'd, and long must love,
                Like common earth can rot;
                To me there needs no stone to tell,
                'T is Nothing that I lov'd so well.</p>

            <p>Yet did I love thee to the last
                As fervently as thou,
                Who didst not change through all the past,
                And canst not alter now.
                The love where Death has set his seal,
                Nor age can chill, nor rival steal,
                Nor falsehood disavow:
                And, what were worse, thou canst not see
                Or wrong, or change, or fault in me.</p>

            <p>The better days of life were ours;
                The worst can be but mine:
                The sun that cheers, the storm that lowers,
                Shall never more be thine.
                The silence of that dreamless sleep
                I envy now too much to weep;
                Nor need I to repine
                That all those charms have pass'd away,
                I might have watch'd through long decay.</p>

            <p>The flower in ripen'd bloom unmatch'd
                Must fall the earliest prey;
                Though by no hand untimely snatch'd,
                The leaves must drop away:
                And yet it were a greater grief
                To watch it withering, leaf by leaf,
                Than see it pluck'd to-day;
                Since earthly eye but ill can bear
                To trace the change to foul from fair.</p>
